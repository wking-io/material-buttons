# material buttons
This is just something I made during a span of projects where I wanted to use elements from Google's Material Design without having to pull in an entire framework like Angular Material or Materialize

All you need to do is copy the style.min.css into your project and use the classes shown in index.html

## ToDo:
I will be adding better docs soon!
